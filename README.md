# SFTPBackup

My SFTP Server Backup utility is a simple executable that:

1. Connects to a SFTP server
2. Downloads the files / folders specified on the config file
3. Compresses them into a timestamped .7z archive
4. Moves the archive to your desired backup location

This was primarily made to create world backups of a minecraft server.
